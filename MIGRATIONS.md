# Migration guide

How to upgrade between versions of `putitoutthere`. Sections are ordered
newest-first; each one is self-contained. Every observable change to
public API gets a section — additive changes as well as breaking ones —
because versioning is not yet strictly semver.

Each section covers five things, in order:

1. **Summary** — what changed and why.
2. **Required changes** — before/after diffs for config, CLI flags, and
   action inputs.
3. **Deprecations removed** — anything previously warned about that is
   now gone.
4. **Behavior changes without code changes** — same API, different
   runtime behavior (tag format, exit codes, default values).
5. **Verification** — commands you can run to confirm the upgrade
   worked, with the expected output.
